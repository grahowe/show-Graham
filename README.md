##### My favorite food is spaghetti.

My favorite food is spaghetti. I like spaghetti because it is good and can be eaten with **meatballs** or just **the sauce.** Spaghetti is most commonly associated with Italy because it originates from this country. To make spaghetti, you can use angel hair pasta and pre-canned tomato sauce. Or if you're feeling *really adventurous*, you can scratch make your own sauce! A big bowl of spaghetti is the perfect food to eat after a long day at work or school.
